Simulation of Whist Card Game

## Card Game 

* There are 4 players 
* Deck of 52 cards 
* Shuffle the deck
* Distribute the cards among players 
* Choose a random trump suit before the start of the game 	
* Choose a random starting player 
* Start the game.
* First player puts a card on table. 
* Subsequently other players also put their cards on the table. 
* At the end of 4 cards, one of the players is declared winner based on card evaluation. 
* The winner of this round starts the next round and so on. 

### Evaluation logic 

Suit of the first card in a round is the suit of the hand. 

Trump suit > suit of the hand > others
A > K > Q > J > 10 > 9 > 8  …  > 3 > 2

### Rule of the game 
If a player has a card of suit of the hand, he has to put it irrespective of whether or not he is going to win. 

### Player logic : 

* If player is starting the round, he puts the highest face value card that he has.
* If not the starting player,  
  * If he can win the round so far, put the card with highest chance of winning
  * If he can’t win the round so far, put the card that minimizes the loss.
